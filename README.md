# Hello World Quiz

Hello World Quiz is an Android application where the user is presented with how to say "Hello World" in a random programming language and have to guess which language it is. They have 60 seconds to get as many questions right as they can.

## Motivation

This project was started as a way to learn the Kotlin programming language through a fun and simple application. In addition this project was used to gain experience developing an application that utilizes Firebase and a Firestore database. 

## Features

* Timed quiz
* Dynamic ImageViews that allow for resizing and scrolling
* Users accounts
* Tracking of personal, weekly, and all-time top scores
* Settings to change the display name, password, and enable/disable sounds

## Installation

Hello World Quiz can be downloaded and installed through the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store). To build this app from the source code see this [tutorial](https://www.londonappdeveloper.com/how-to-clone-a-github-project-on-android-studio/) for details. Specific build instructions for Hello World Quiz are currently being written.
